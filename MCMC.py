#- Let's say I offer to play a game with you, where you take an unbiased coin, flip it a thousand times, then we take the number of heads (H) and subtract it from the number of tails (T), and I pay you $|(H-T)|. So if there are 520 heads and 480 tails, I'll owe you $40, but if it were reversed, you'd owe me nothing. How much would you be willing to pay to play this game with me, i.e. whatâ€™s the expected value of this game?
